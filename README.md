# Chrome-Extension

This is the third project on the Learn Javascript Course on Scrimba and its a chrome extension that saves links and tabs

To test the project:
https://chrome-extension11.netlify.app/

Note : the save tab button will not work in the link above because it uses methods that only work when it opened as a chrome extension
